In JavaScript, there are two types of task queues for managing asynchronous code execution: the callback queue (also known as the message queue) and the microtask queue. The microtask queue is used to handle smaller, higher-priority tasks compared to the callback queue. Microtasks are typically executed before the callback queue.

Here's an overview of the microtask queue and how it works:

1. **Microtasks vs. Callbacks:**
   - Microtasks are tasks with higher priority compared to regular callbacks (also known as macrotasks).
   - Regular callbacks include tasks like timers (e.g., `setTimeout`), I/O operations, DOM events, and user interactions.
   - Microtasks include tasks like promises, `async/await`, and mutation observers.

2. **Order of Execution:**
   - Microtasks are executed before regular callbacks from the callback queue.
   - When a microtask is added to the microtask queue, it is processed immediately if the JavaScript execution stack is empty.

3. **Promises and Microtasks:**
   - Promises play a significant role in populating the microtask queue.
   - When a promise is resolved or rejected, its attached callbacks (via `.then()` or `.catch()`) are added to the microtask queue.

Here's an example demonstrating the execution order of microtasks and callbacks:

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Callback 1");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Microtask 1");
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Microtask 2");
});

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Callback 2");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
```

In this example, you will see the following order of execution:

1. "Start" is logged to the console.
2. Two promises (`Microtask 1` and `Microtask 2`) are added to the microtask queue.
3. "End" is logged to the console.
4. Two callbacks (`Callback 1` and `Callback 2`) are added to the callback queue.
5. The microtasks are executed before the callbacks, so `Microtask 1` and `Microtask 2` are logged before `Callback 1` and `Callback 2`.
